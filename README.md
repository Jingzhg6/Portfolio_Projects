## Google Merchandise Report: 

My teammates and I conducted this project, as indicated on the first page of the report. The report was created within the Looker Studio environment and focuses on two primary subjects:

1. Performance of Google Merchant Center Website: This section covers various aspects, including keywords, audience, acquisition, user behavior, conversion, and LinkedIn analysis (data provided by Professor Alexis FERCHICHI). The data in the PDF report is current as of May 12, 2023, while the original report, with real-time data, can be accessed through the link below.

2. Social Media Analysis of Emlyon Business School: This segment pertains to the analysis of Emlyon Business School's Twitter account. The data used for this analysis is dated back to November 23, 2022, which corresponds to the date when we finalized the report.

## Performance Dashboard for V+:

This team project was carried out within the Looker Studio environment under the guidance of Professor Anna ABREU. The project's objective is to offer visitors an interactive dashboard to explore the performance of a fictional bike rental company, V+. Our aim is to provide visitors with insights into how various factors influence the company's performance, enabling them to gain a comprehensive understanding of these relationships.

## Airbnb Dashboard:

This team project was accomplished in collaboration with the same colleagues from the V+ team, under the guidance of Professor Cao Tri DO, using Power BI. The dashboard we have developed allows visitors to interact with and gain insights into the global overview of Airbnb properties in New York City. This includes information such as the average property price, review scores, and property distributions across various neighborhoods. Visitors can also identify good and bad practitioners by customizing different criteria based on their preferences. Additionally, the dashboard includes predefined criteria for different practitioner types.

Please kindly reach out to me if you intend to engage with the dashboard.

# **Other Projects**

## Agile Project Management
This project consists of a PowerPoint document that presents the overall concept of our entire project, along with all relevant charts and sheets, as well as a YouTube channel. These materials were developed as part of a group project during our exchange program at McGill University in 2023. Our project aligns with the Agile Project Management course, and the YouTube channel serves as a practical means for us to master project management. We began with the iteration plan, which you can find in the PowerPoint, covering elements such as the charter, vision, road map, and releases, and continued until we achieved the final outcome.

Our project has received guidance from Professor Sylvain GAUTHIER, and the YouTube channel is owned and managed by Auriane Bardonnet
